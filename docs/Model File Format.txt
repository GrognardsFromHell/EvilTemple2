Start of File:

Offsets are hexadecimal

There is an additional constraint: Chunks must be present in ascending order
of their type. This is required for interdependent chunks.

Offset Data
  0000 MODL Magic (4 byte)
  0004 Version (4 byte unsigned integer)
  0008 CRC32 (4-byte hash value)
  000C Number of chunks (4-byte unsigned integer)
  0010 First Chunk

// Chunks MUST start on 16-byte boundaries relating to the start of the file

Chunk Header:
  00000000 Type (32-bit unsigned integer)
  00000004 Flags (32-bit unsigned integer) (0x1 indicates *required* chunk)
  00000008 Reserved (32-bit unsigned integer)
  0000000C Size (32-bit unsigned integer) (Constraint: Multiple of 16)

Materials Chunk (Type: 1)
  Contains materials used by the faces of this mesh. It's pre-cooked, containing all the textures/shaders used by this mesh.
  Having a material chunk with count == 0 is equivalent to having no material chunk at all.

  Header:
  00000000 Material Count
  00000004 Unused 1
  00000008 Unused 2
  0000000A Unused 3

  Followed by the following structure for each Material:
  00000000 Type
  

Geometry Chunk (Type: 2)
  Contains vertices and their attributes

  Header:
  00000000 Number of vertices (32-bit unsigned integer)
  00000004 Unused 1 (32-bit unsigned integer)
  00000008 Unused 2 (32-bit unsigned integer)
  0000000A Unused 3 (32-bit unsigned integer)

  Followed by one position for each vertex:
  00000000 X coordinate (32-bit float)
  00000004 Y coordinate (32-bit float)
  00000008 Z coordinate (32-bit float)
  0000000A W coordinate (32-bit float, MUST BE 1.0)

  Followed by one normal for each vertex (MUST BE normalized):
  00000000 X coordinate (32-bit float)
  00000004 Y coordinate (32-bit float)
  00000008 Z coordinate (32-bit float)
  0000000A W coordinate (32-bit float, MUST BE 0.0)

  Followed by one texture coordinate for each vertex:
  00000000 U coordinate (32-bit float, [0,1])
  00000004 V coordinate (32-bit float, [0,1])

Face Chunk (Type: 3)
  Contains triangles grouped by their material (for drawing with fewer context switches), called face groups.

  Header:
  00000000 Number of face groups (32-bit unsigned integer)
  00000004 Unused 1 (32-bit unsigned integer)
  00000008 Unused 2 (32-bit unsigned integer)
  0000000A Unused 3 (32-bit unsigned integer)

  Followed by the following structure for each face group:
  00000000 Index of used material. -1 for none. Related to Materials chunk. (32-bit signed integer)
  00000004 Number of indices (Number of triangles in group * 3) (32-bit unsigned integer)
  00000008 Size of an index in byte. i.E. 2 for unsigned short. (32-bit unsigned integer)
  0000000A Unused (32-bit unsigned integer)
  00000010 Index data (Element Size * Element Count bytes, unpadded)
