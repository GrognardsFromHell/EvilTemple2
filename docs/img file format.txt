The IMG file format is used to separate bigger images into textures by the ToEE UI system.

Examples are the splash screen (art/splash/legal0322.img) and other images used as window backgrounds.

The img file contains only 4 byte:

struct ImageFile {
	short width; // pixels
	short height; // pixels
}


The actual image data is stored in TGA files.

If the name of the IMG file is legal0322.img, the image data is contained in the same folder in legal0322_<X>_<Y>.tga, where <X> and <Y> are
indices. so legal0322_0_0.tga is the first image (all images have 256x256 pixel dimensions). The origin of the coordinate system is the lower left corner.
