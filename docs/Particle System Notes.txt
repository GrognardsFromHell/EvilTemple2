SpawnRate is number of particles spawned per second (tested via fraps and modified particle systems)

Lifetime 30 & Rate = 1 -> Particle lived 1 second, 1 particle spawned per second
Lifetime 30 & Rate = 2 -> Particle lived 1 seconds, 2 particle spawned per second

Lifetime 60 & Rate = 1 -> Particle lived 1 seconds, 2 particle spawned per second
Lifetime 60 & Rate = 2 -> Particle lived 1 seconds, 4 particle spawned per second

30 seems to be the base unit (=1 second)
